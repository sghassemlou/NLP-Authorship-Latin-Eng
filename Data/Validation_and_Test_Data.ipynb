For Joiada the high priest permitted not the companies to depart, which were accustomed to succeed one another every week.   \n25                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         For how can I endure the murdering and slaughter of my people?

Have you called us to the wedding on purpose to strip us?   \n67                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               And when they were gone out, the other sons of Jacob came upon the slain; and plundered the city in revenge of the rape.   \n68                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          If necessary, supply six complete equipments.   \n72                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           In addition to this, there is the fact that the Roman people from the beginning of their rule have preferred to seek friends rather than slaves; they have thought it safer to govern the willing than those forced to obey.   \n74                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      He hath filled the hungry with good things: and the rich he hath sent empty away.   \n75                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     non fecit taliter omni nationi et iudicia sua non manifestavit eis   \n79                                                                                                                                                                                And be ashamed of all that they have done. Shew them the form of the house, and of the fashion thereof, the goings out and the comings in, and the whole plan thereof, and all its ordinances, and all its order, and all its laws, and thou shalt write it in their sight: that they may keep the whole form thereof, and its ordinances, and do them.   \n97                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             He that toucheth the corpse of a man, and is therefore unclean seven days,   \n100                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       And there was a third battle in Gob against the Philistines, in which Adeodatus the son of the Forrest an embroiderer of Bethlehem slew Goliath the Gethite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.   \n103                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I am not worthy of the least of all thy mercies, and of thy truth which thou hast fulfilled to thy servant. With my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I return with two companies.   \n106                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   He died in his fifty-sixth year. If anyone questions this let him call to mind his first consulship, to which he was elected in his thirty-eighth year, and he will cease to doubt.   \n107                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    And Jesus answering, said to him: What wilt thou that I should do to thee? And the blind man said to him: Rabboni. That I may see.   \n117  will you not do everything in your power in defense of the liberty which they bequeathed to you'and all the more ardently, seeing that it is a greater disgrace to lose what has been won than never to have acquired it? Someone will say, What then do you advise? My view is that those who have betrayed their country to the enemy must be punished, yet not by might and not by violence (which it is a less becoming act for you to perform than for them to suffer) but rather by the courts and by Jugurthas own testimony.   \n119                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            And though he knew his brethren, he was not known by them.   \n123                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I said: Where are they?

round about us have fought against us.   \n259



brothers of Dina, taking their swords, entered boldly into the city, and slew all the men:   \n273

houses as a desert: and they shall build houses, and shall not dwell in them: and they shall plant vineyards, and shall not drink the wine of them.   \n281

commandments, which I command thee this day, the Lord thy God will make thee higher than all the nations that are on the earth.   \n284

if the district is good, they should be well kept.   \n285

that they may return every man from his wicked way: and I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin.   \n288

backs, and fled away from the battle.   \n520                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                But they slew of the Moabites at that time, about ten thousand, all strong and valiant men: none of them could escape.   \n522

travail: except it be a vision sent forth from the most High, set not thy heart upon them.   \n523

                                    Now very shortly I will pour out my wrath upon thee, and I will accomplish my anger in thee: and I will judge thee according to thy ways, and I will lay upon thee all thy crimes.   \n524



say again (Let no man think me to be foolish: otherwise take me as one foolish, that I also may glory a little):   \n540

fight except from ambush or in a place advantageous to him) and that the summer was now at an end, he left Zama and placed garrisons in the cities that had gone over to him and were strongly enough fortified by their position or by walls.   \n541

one to comfort thy soul, and cherish thy old age. For he is born of thy daughter in law: who loveth thee: and is much better to thee, than if thou hadst seven sons.   \n547                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           usquequo exaltabitur inimicus meus super me   \n549                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    He said: This is the word that the Lord hath commanded to be done.   \n550                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Five men also, the last of his brethren, he presented before the king:   \n551                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     And I will save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will call for corn, and will multiply it, and will lay no famine upon you.   \n552                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Instead of a friend become not an enemy to thy neighbour: for an evil man shall inherit reproach and shame, so shall every sinner that is envious and double tongued.   \n553                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Then Paul said: I stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be judged.

Thus far are the words of Jeremias.   \n566                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     And he called upon the Lord God, and said: Lord, there is no difference with thee, whether thou help with few, or with many: help us, O Lord our God: for with confidence in thee, and in thy name we are come against this multitude. O Lord thou art our God, let not man prevail against thee.   \n568                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the ancients? For they wash not their hands when they eat bread.   \n572                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      And Solomon built his own house in thirteen years, and brought it to perfection.   \n577                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Then Nabuchodonosor, the king, was astonished, and rose up in haste, and said to his nobles: Did we not cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered the king, and said: True, O king.   \n578

                                    And honey, and butter, and sheep, and fat calves, and they gave to David and the people that were with him, to eat: for they suspected that the people were faint with hunger and thirst in the wilderness.   \n628

                                                                                                                                       Thereafter, during Hannibals stay in Italy, and in the next few years subsequent to his departure, the Romans had no leisure for the founding of colonies, since, while the war lasted, they had to find soldiers, rather than muster them out, and, after it was over, the strength of the city needed to be revived and concentrated rather than to be dispersed.   \n634                                                                                                           For it grieves me to state certain facts: how during the past fifteen years you have been the plaything of a few mens insolence; how shamefully and without being avenged your defenders have perished; how your spirit has been corrupted as a consequence of cowardice and indolence; even now you take no action, when your enemies are at your mercy, and even now you fear those in whom you

let it be given to Jonathan, and set upon the holy mountain, in a conspicuous place.   \n680

lay claim to for themselves as a result of others merit they do not allow to me as the result of my own, no doubt because I have no ancestral images and because mine is a freshly minted nobility; yet

husband: for whom they may become unclean.   \n752

And being strengthened, he sat on his bed.   \n859                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         But about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing, and he saith to them: Why stand you here all the day idle?   \n860                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Having made these arrangements, the king withdrew to places as secluded as possible; and a little later he learned that Marius with a few cohorts had been sent to fetch grain on a detour to Sicca, which was the very first town to revolt from the king after his defeat in the battle.   \n864                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Wherefore he saith: Rise, thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead: and Christ shall enlighten thee.   \n871                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     And you shall say to the goodman of the house: The master saith to thee: Where is the guest chamber, where I may eat the pasch with my disciples?   \n877                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall rise again.

And the sons of Semei: Nadab, and Abisur.   \n880                                                            When Gauda asked Metellus to be allowed the kingly privilege of sitting on an official chair next to him and afterward for a squadron of Roman Knights to serve as a bodyguard, Metellus refused both requests: the honor on the ground that by custom it belonged only to those who had been formally recognized as kings by the Romans; the guard, on the ground it would have been an insult to Roman Knights if they were handed over to a Numidian as his attendants.   \n883                                                                                                                                                                                                                          After this I beheld in the vision of the night, and lo, a fourth beast, terrible and wonderful, and exceeding strong, it had great iron teeth, eating and breaking in pieces, and treading down the rest with his feet: and it was unlike to the other beasts which I had seen before it, and had ten horns.   \n884                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                And Jersia, and Elia, and Zechri, the sons of Jeroham.   \n890                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      And after six days Jesus taketh unto him Peter and James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart:   \n893                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Just lips are the delight of kings: he that speaketh right things shall be loved.   \n894                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Every proud man is an abomination to the Lord: though hand should be joined to hand, he is not innocent. The beginning of a good way is to do justice: and this is more acceptable with God, than to offer sacrifices.   \n896

down with my Father in his throne.   \n898
